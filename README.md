# face-mask-detection-system
Since this COVID-19 pandemic, mask is a necessary requirement to go outside. This project can be integrated with built-in application systems at Ariports, Offices, Colleges, School and at public spaces to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications necessitate the detection of face masks for safety purposes as a necessary consequence of the outbreak of this Covid-19 pandemic.

No coalesced veiled data set was used for the face mask detector. 
The model is precise, and since I used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it is also computationally effective and therefore the platform would be easier to deploy on most embedded systems (i.e. Raspberry Pi, Google Coral and more).

Here are some pictures down below for reference!
